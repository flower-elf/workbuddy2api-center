#  macOS counterpart of allow-firewall.bat (LAN mode helper)

#  macOS does not use Windows Firewall rules. Its application
#  firewall asks for permission the first time a program listens
#  on a port - choose [Allow] then.
#
#  This script prints the current firewall state and can add the
#  proxy's Python interpreter to the allowed list (asks for your
#  password).
#
#  Usage: double-click, or  ./allow-firewall.command [port]
